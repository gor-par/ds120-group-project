# Netflix dataset analysis

Data Analysis using Python or R, by Vanessa Avoyan, Arytom Muradyan, Viktoria Makarian, Gor Parisakoyan

**Project Description:** The project involves analyzing data from CSV files using either Python or R
programming language. The aim of the project is to gain insights into the data and present them in a
meaningful way.

**Outline**

- [Minimum requirements](#minimum-requirements)
- [Data Selection](#data-selection)

## Minimum Requirements

- Data Selection: Choose at least 1 CSV file for your analysis. You can have more than one sources of
  data, as long as they have a common topic and you can give a title to your project. The data should
  have some level of complexity and variety. If you collect your data from somewhere, have this part of
  the codes in your project files as well.
- Data Cleaning: Clean the data to remove any missing values, duplicates, or outliers. Ensure that
  the data is in the correct format for analysis.
- Data Visualization: Use appropriate data visualization techniques to present the insights gained
  from the analysis. This could include histograms, scatter plots, line charts, bar charts and many
  others (some interesting ideas can be found for example here: http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html). The project should have at least 5 descriptive plots that have
  conclusions/insights. All plots should have proper titles and axis labels.
- Final Report: Prepare a final report in either Jupyter Notebook or R Markdown format. The report
  should include the following sections:

  1. Introduction: A brief overview of the project, its goals, and the data used.
  2. Data: A description of the data used, including its source, structure, and any relevant features.
  3. Experiments: A description of the experiments performed on the data, including data cleaning,
     exploration, visualization, and modeling. This section should include code snippets and visual-
     izations that support the findings.
  4. Conclusion: A summary of the findings of the analysis, including any insights gained, limitations,
     and recommendations for future work.

- Code Documentation: Document your code thoroughly to ensure that it is easily understood and
  maintained. Use comments and clear variable names to make the code more readable.
- Programming Language: The project can be done using either Python or R or a combination of
  both. However, the data files and analysis results should be properly submitted regardless of the
  language used. Please make a compressed file (ex. zip file) from all files and upload via moodle by the
  deadline.
- _The above requirements are the minimum that should be included in the project. You
  can add more features to the project as per your requirements and interest. Make sure
  to organize your code and report in a logical and clear manner to make it easily under-
  standable_

## Data Selection

[Huge Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/netflix-inc/netflix-prize-data) by Netflix itself, but is complex and likely harder to work with, tables are in txt. Was used to create recommendation systems for Netflix.

[Separate table of Netflix users](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavsmayan/netflix-userbase-dataset/data), can be used for behavior analysis

4 different, but really similar datasets of movies and shows. Each has a column that the others don't (one has rating, other has genres, etc), so we can pick the appropriate dataset for each of the analyses, or join them together. Listed in by their download popularity

- [First](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows)
- [Second](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ariyoomotade/netflix-data-cleaning-analysis-and-visualization)
- [Third](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/narayan63/netflix-popular-movies-dataset)
- [Fourth](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavvvvv/netflix-movies-and-tv-shows)

[Smaller dataset](https://data.world/gonzandrobles/netflix-movies-and-series) that IMDB ratings (not from kaggle)
Alternatively, we can use IMDB datasets ourselves
[IMDB Dbs](https://datasets.imdbws.com/) â€“ Details about each database can be found [here](https://developer.imdb.com/non-commercial-datasets/)

[Similar dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/amazon-prime-movies-and-tv-shows) for Amazon just in case
